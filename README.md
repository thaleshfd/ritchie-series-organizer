# Description

This formula helps you to organize your series files (any file extension) into separate folders.

All files that don't match to the name and pattern, will be moved to **NotMatchFiles** folder _(this code is not too smart ðŸ˜­ )_.

The files names must contain the correct name provided and the season and episode pattern, for example:

```ANYANY_ANYSERIES NAMEANY_ANY S06E02.any```
This file will be moved to a new folder S06 and renamed to SERIES NAME - S0602.any
